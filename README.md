###### Networks

A network is when **one or more computers send information to each other.** They're all connected. This process of sending information is called network communication.

Just like how people communicate by talking, writing, or even singing, computers do the same thing. There are different types of networks.

For communication over a short distance, there are Local Area Networks (LANs). If you need computers to communicate over a longer distance, you can use a Wide Area Network (WAN).

Imagine you're talking to a friend in the same room. You don't need to shout to say "Hi." They can easily see and hear you. That's like a LAN.

Now, imagine you're shouting from the top of a mountain in the Himalayas (in Asia), and your friend is shouting back from the Rocky Mountains (in North America), and you can still understand each other. That's like a WAN. It's the largest type of network, connecting places across countries and even continents.

###### Intro to Networks protcols
When you talk to a friend, you have a kind of understanding about how you'll communicate. If you're in the same room (like a LAN), you just talk normally. If you're far apart (like a WAN), you might have to shout or use a phone. Computers are similar â€“ they have rules, or instructions, for how to talk to each other effectively.

* Packets: These are like little envelopes that hold the information being sent.
* Internet Protocol (IP) Address: This is a unique address that identifies each computer on a network, like a house address.
    * Note: Your IP address can change depending on where you connect to the internet. It's not always the same.
    * Example: 192.158.1.38 (The numbers in an IP address can range from 0 to 255.)

Once the information is packed into packets, it needs to be delivered to the correct IP address. There are different ways to do this.
